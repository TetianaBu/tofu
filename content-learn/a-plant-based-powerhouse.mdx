One of tofu's key attributes is its high protein content, making it an excellent source of protein. It is also a rich source of essential amino acids, iron, calcium, and various vitamins. Additionally, tofu contains compounds called isoflavones, which have been linked to several health benefits, including reduced risk of heart disease and certain cancers.
