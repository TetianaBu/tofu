Tofu's origins can be traced back to ancient China over 2,000 years ago. Legend has it that a Chinese cook accidentally curdled soy milk, leading to the creation of this remarkable food. Over centuries, tofu spread across Asia and eventually the world, adapting to various culinary traditions and tastes.
